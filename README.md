All will become clear.

## Overview
`falign` is a smart and powerful formatter as well as parser. Almost anything it is capable of formatting may be parsed using the same spec.  The spec picks and chooses its favorite qualites from printf, from python's format and adds some of its own flavor crystals.  It makes one big assumption which is that everything may be formatted (not necessarily parsed) as a string. "Hey, why do that", you say. "I loose my ability to format different types!"  Do you? What you loose is the ability to align:
* align columns
* align to a specified width
* and parse using that very same knowledge.
And do you really loose it? You know what your data is. If you want your bits of data to take on some particular encoding then you know better than any formatter every will. Format your `Date`s your `Number`s, your special sauce however you like. And then let this guy arrange it exactly as you like with `falign`.
